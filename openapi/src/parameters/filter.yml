  description: Filters resources in the endpoint based on "label-specific" or
    "simple generic" filters. Label-specific filters have their behavior and
    syntax defined by the server (e.g., a filter for resources available in
    desired languages, `filter[lang]=eng,ita,deu`). Simple generic filters
    combine a field (among the fields in the resources present in `data`) and
    a logical operand (e.g., filter resources with a last update value greater
    than a certain date, `filter[lastUpdate][gt]=2021-04-01`). The operands
    and their behavior is defined by the standard. Filters may refer to nested
    fields (e.g., `filter[name.eng][exists]=true`). If the server is unable
    process any filter, it shall respond with `400 Bad Request`.

    Filters resources in the endpoint based on "label-specific" or
    "simple generic" filters. The available filters are:
      - `filter[lang]`: filters resources containing text data in the desired
      languages (e.g., `filter[lang]=eng,ita,deu`). Receives comma-separated
      ISO 639-3 languages tags.

      - `filter[lastUpdate][gt]`: filters resources updated after a desired
      date (e.g., `filter[lastUpdate][gt]=2021-04-01`). Receives an ISO 8601
      date string.
      
      - `filter[lastUpdate][lt]`: filters resources updated before a desired
      date (e.g., `filter[lastUpdate][gt]=2021-04-01`). Receives an ISO 8601
      date string.

      - `filter[categories][any]`: filters resources having any of the desired
      categories (e.g., `filter[categories][any]=example:cat1,example:cat2`).
      Receives comma-separated category ids.

      - `filter[categories][all]`: filters resources having all of the desired
      categories (e.g., `filter[categories][all]=example:cat1,example:cat2`).
      Receives comma-separated category ids.

      - `filter[geometries][near]`: filters resources whose geometries are near
      a desired GPS point (e.g.,
      `filter[geometries][near]=11.309245,46.862025,10000`). Receives three
      comma-separated numbers in the following order: a longitude value, a
      latitude value, and a proximity radius in meters.

    Notice that if you wish to use one of these examples in a request you must
    represent them as a JSON objects due to the supported serialization of
    objects in URLs: for label-specific filters, `{ "lang": "eng,ita,deu" }`;
    and for simple generic filters, `{ "lastUpdate": { "gt": "2021-04-01" } }`.
    If the server is unable process any filter, it shall respond with `400 Bad
    Request`.
